Following Wolfenstein 3D, John Carmack and John Romero continued their common
adventure. Once realizing some additional levels for Wolf3D special editions, they started
wotking on the sequel. Bigger, better, stronger. Towards the end of 1993, they released
Doom, another first-person shoot’em up. The immersion is even more intense, the atmosphere is even more engaging, and Doom immediately became, and remained, a reference
in video games.

In the UAC’s (Union Aerospace Corporation) premises on Mars, you play an exMarine who has to clean the base of a whole bunch of monsters coming straight from
hell. These appeared because of radioactive experiments that created a breach in spacetime. Each monster uglier than the one before, up to the huge final boss, you’re going
to need all the weapons available to defeat them. Ultra violent gameplay, tempo set by
the Heavy Metal soundtrack, even today you can’t call yourself a gamer if you’ve never
played it.

As the the ID Software adventures were unfolding, another universe was built in another video game company: Apogee Software. As early as 1991, in Los Angeles invaded
by aliens, Duke Nukem is fighting to take them down. At the time, it’s only a Mario-style
2D platform. After a swift incursion in space for the second scenario in 1993, the 1996
third version is a 3D, first person game. With more visual effects than Doom, a cartoonlike design and lots of sex, violence, cult dialogues and off-beat humor, this third opus is
a dazzling success. Released under the Apogee Software’s 3D Realms brand, Duke Nukem
3D becomes Doom’s rightful heir in the realm of pseudo 3D games, before the emergence
of GPUs and hardware acceleration to create full 3D.
